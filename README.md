# Challenge #1 & #2

This repository contains the solutions for **Challenge #1** and **Challenge #2**. Challenge #1 focuses on loading and processing data using tools and languages such as Python and MySQL. The main goal was to create an efficient system for loading and transforming data from CSV files into a MySQL database, while handling potential null values and date formats properly.

**Challenge #2** extends the previous challenge by incorporating improvements in efficiency and security for the data loading process. The `LOAD DATA INFILE` MySQL function was used to load large volumes of data more quickly, and validation and error handling mechanisms were implemented to ensure data integrity.

Additionally, backup files and **Avro** files are included to support data recovery and compatibility with different data formats. These files help demonstrate the capability to manage both relational and schema-less data formats in the project workflow.

Both challenges represent an integrated approach to improving data workflows and optimizing database interactions for data analysis and transformation projects.
